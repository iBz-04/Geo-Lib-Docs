# Expanding GeoLib

GeoLib has laid a strong foundation for working with geometric shapes in Python. With the current focus on squares and triangles, the library is a practical tool for basic geometric operations. However, there’s so much more potential on the horizon. Here’s a look at what’s next for GeoLib and how the open-source nature of the project plays a crucial role in its expansion.

## Adding Support for More Shapes

One of the most exciting directions for GeoLib is the addition of support for more geometric shapes. Here’s a glimpse at what might be coming:

Circles: Circles are another fundamental shape in geometry. Adding circle support would enable calculations of areas, circumferences, and diameters, as well as operations like scaling and comparing circles.

Polygons: Moving beyond basic shapes, polygons introduce a new level of complexity. Support for both regular and irregular polygons would allow users to calculate perimeters, areas, and even perform transformations like rotations and scaling.

3D Shapes: Expanding into three-dimensional geometry is another possible future direction. Shapes like spheres, cubes, and pyramids could be added, bringing new use cases such as calculating volumes and surface areas.

## Integration with Other Python Libraries

Another area of growth for GeoLib is integration with other popular Python libraries. By providing compatibility and working seamlessly with these libraries, GeoLib could become a key component in a broader ecosystem of Python tools.

Matplotlib: Integrating GeoLib with Matplotlib, a popular plotting library, would allow users to visualize the shapes and operations they’re working with.

##  Get Involved on GitHub
One of the most exciting aspects of GeoLib is that it’s open source. This project thrives on community involvement, and we’re actively seeking contributors to help take GeoLib to the next level. Whether you’re an experienced developer or just getting started with open-source contributions, there’s a place for you in this project.

Here’s how you can get involved:

`Fork the Repository`: Visit the GeoLib [Github Repository](https://github.com/iBz-04/GeoLib), fork it, and start working on your ideas. Whether you’re adding new shapes, improving documentation, or fixing bugs, every contribution helps.

`Create Issues and Pull Requests`: If you have suggestions or encounter any issues, feel free to open an [Issue](https://github.com/iBz-04/GeoLib/issues) on GitHub. If you’ve implemented a new feature or made improvements, submit a pull request for review.

`Join the Discussion`: Engage with other developers in the [Community](https://github.com/iBz-04/GeoLib/discussions). Share your insights, ask questions, and collaborate on building something special.

By contributing to `GeoLib`, you’ll not only help the library grow, but you’ll also gain valuable experience working on a real-world Python project. We encourage developers of all levels to participate, contribute code, provide feedback, or even just share your thoughts.
