# Deployment

## UNDER DEVELOPMENT! 

<!-- ## GitHub Pages

This project comes with a GitHub Actions script that automatically generates a deployment file that runs after you commit your changes and then commits to the gh-pages branch.

To use it, just set the GitHub Pages deployment branch to gh-pages.

> If the GitHub Actions script does not run automatically after you commit your changes, check to see if there is another branch in your repository, or you can run the script manually. -->

<!-- ## Netlify

This project comes with [**Build Profile**](https://github.com/importantimport/urara/blob/main/netlify.toml) for Netlify, so when importing the project, there is no need to fill in the build settings.

To deploy this project on Netlify, you need to have a Netlify account and install the [**Netlify app**](https://github.com/apps/netlify/installations/new) in the desired repository to access the selected repository.

Next, just follow the [**Import an existing project**](https://app.netlify.com/start) page to complete the deployment process.

## Vercel

To deploy this project on Vercel, you need to have a Vercel account to start [**Add New Project**](https://vercel.com/new).

You can import projects from a public git repository, or to import a private GitHub repository, you need to associate a GitHub account for authorization.

Once you select a repository, Vercel automatically recognizes the repository and selects the appropriate schema without having to fill in the build and output settings.

You can also add additional settings as needed, then deploy, and wait for the deployment to complete. -->
