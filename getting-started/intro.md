# Intro

Welcome to the GeoLib documentation! This guide will walk you through the process of getting started with GeoLib

## Overview

- This library was built with `@Python 3.12.5`

- Geolib is useful for handling basic geometric shapes like squares and triangles, in future versions other shapes will be supported

- This is an open-source project on github, meaning anyone can make a supervised contribution to make Geolib better
